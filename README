Notes

This application serves as a coding exercise in which I was given written
instructions, but no means to ask further questions. Therefore, when there
were ambiguities in the instructions, rather than ask for clarification from
my "client", I was forced to make a decision. In a real-world situation, I
would have much preferred to ask rather than assume! (Also, I am not a baseball
stats nut, so my knowledge of the stats are limited to the instructions I was
given.)

The assumptions I have made are as follows:

1.  I have assumed that a player can play for multiple teams in a given year.
2.  When you asked for the "slugging percentage for all players on the Oakland"
    "A's in 2007", I have interpreted that to mean that you are looking for the
    slugging percentage for each player who served any time on the Oakland roster
    in 2007, and furthermore that you want their slugging percentages for the entire
    year, not just their time in Oakland (if they were on multiple rosters that year).
3.  In the event that a player has played for rosters in both the NL and AL,
    he would be eligible for Triple Crown consideration for both leagues, but his
    entire stats line for that season (in both leagues) would be the basis for Triple
    Crown calculations.
